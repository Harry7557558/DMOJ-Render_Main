## Unofficial explanations for DMOJ “meme” problems:

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/helloworldhard**:

The first line is ended with a `\n`, the second line is ended with a `\r`, the third line is ended with `\r\n`.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/thereturnofaplusb**:

There is only one test case, where ~N=1521~. The followed inputs can be in decimal digits, lowercase English words, lowercase French words, or Simplified Chinese characters.

1-10 in decimal: `{ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10" }`

1-10 in English: `{ "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten" }`

1-10 in French: `{ "un", "deux", "trois", "quatre", "cinq", "six", "sept", "huit", "neuf", "dix" }`

1-10 in Chinese: `{ "一", "二", "三", "四", "五", "六", "七", "八", "九", "十" }`

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/miraclesort**:

Output the numbers in the input order will make you pass.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/acc4p0**:

`AK` stands for `All Kill`.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/acc4p6**:

The function to implement is to return `true` if ~n~ is happy. The definition of happy numbers can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/piggy**:

If your submission gets partial AC, the grader's feedback will be `(amaze!!1)`. Submitting it in Text will *likely* make you pass.

Other full-point short Text submissions include `print('Moana')`, `Unicode`, `:Xyene`, `12`, `KFC`, `youtube`, etc.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/scroll**:

There is no input for this problem. Seems like any non-empty output can pass.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/saoj**:

This problem asks you to calculate ~\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N} k^6~, modulo ~1000000000~.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/saoj2**:

As the problem stated, your task is to calculate ~\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N} k~. However, instead of printing the answer in Java, you have to output a C++ code that will write the answer to `stdout` when compiled and executed. The C++ code only prints the answer without reading anything from `stdin`.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/saoj3**:

This problem asks you to read paragraphs from `stdin` and count the occurrences of alphabetic characters. Your output should be 26 non-negative integers in order, the occurrences of `A-Z` in the input text (including both uppercase and lowercase letters), separated by a space.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/cccjqrp3**:

All inputs can fit into 64-bit unsigned integers. Your task is to output ~A+B+C~, modulo ~42069900169420~.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/bf1easy**:

Read the problem statement carefully. It tells you to output the integers from ~1~ to ~N~.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/ludipq**:

There is only one test case. Google "ludipq 123" will give you the sequence is `1,3,3,2,2,1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,1,1`.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/toosimple**:

One can see from existing comments that these characters are not allowed in code: `"'1234567890`.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/tle18p1**:

This problem asks you to recognize digits from bitmap images. The first line of input contains an integer, ~N~, the number of test cases. Followed by ~28N~ lines, each line contains ~28~ real numbers between ~0~ and ~1~, representing ~N~ ~28\times28~ bitmap images, each image contains a decimal digit. For each test case, output the digit in the image, followed by a line break.

The image represented in the sample input can be found in [this comment](https://dmoj.ca/problem/tle18p1#comment-12374).

This problem contains 10 test cases. In all test cases, ~N=1000~. If your program has a proper output, you will receive feedback for the accuracy of your algorithm.

The maximum point for this problem is 512. One guesses the point is calculated as ~\lfloor2^{\lfloor20(a-0.5)\rfloor}\rfloor~, where ~a~ is the minimum accuracy of all test cases.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/cccjqrp5**:

The input for this problem is a lowercase letter in the English alphabet. When the input is `a`, the answer is `a`. Otherwise, you should output the answer to the previous letter of the input letter in the English alphabet plus the input letter plus the answer to the previous letter in the English alphabet.

For example, when the input is `b`, your output should be `a`+`b`+`a`=`aba`. When the input is `c`, your output should be `aba`+`c`+`aba`=`abacaba`.

If the instruction count of your code is greater than or equal to 1000, only 3/4 of points will be given. The grader may return WA even though the output matches.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/tle18p6**:

The picture of the CS nerd in the problem is in SVG format (where all other problem pictures from that contest are PNG). The SVG contains base64-encoded PNG images layered up, in which the picture contents include doors, ghost faces, emojis, photos, codes, etc. All `<image>` objects have an `id` attribute. The SVG also contains an empty `<defs>`, a `<metadata>`, and an invisible `<g>`.

There is a base64-encoded image string with a `\n` line break every 76 characters, while all other images use space instead. The content of that image is an instruction to `Write f:`. Other pictures with code include a screenshot of Sample Input 1 of [this problem](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19s3) and an image that looks like a clipped Brain\*\*\*\* code. The order of the pictures may have some meaning.

Since this problem worths 40 points, solving it *may* require some coding skills more than understanding the statement of the problem. This problem has AC submissions in Text and C++, as well as Text TLE submissions.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/csprng**:

If your program tries to request, it crashes.

If your program outputs `the following file`, the grader's feedback will be `Nice try, print the actual file`.

To fail solutions that use data compression, the grader has been updated to detect non-ASCII characters.

Notice problem statement:

> a hardware token that he has locally... uniformly at random within the range configured...
> Your score will be inversely correlated to the length of your program...
> To ensure you have the correct output...
