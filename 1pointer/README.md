## Unofficial explanations for DMOJ “meme” problems:

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/helloworldhard:**

The first line is ended with a `\n`, the second line is ended with a `\r`, and the third line is ended with `\r\n`.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/thereturnofaplusb:**

There is only one test case, where ~N=1521~. The inputs followed can be in digits, lowercase English words, lowercase French words, or Simplified Chinese characters.

1-10 in decimal digits: `{ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10" }`

1-10 in English: `{ "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten" }`

1-10 in French: `{ "un", "deux", "trois", "quatre", "cinq", "six", "sept", "huit", "neuf", "dix" }`

1-10 in Chinese: `{ "一", "二", "三", "四", "五", "六", "七", "八", "九", "十" }`

Output the numbers in the input order will make you pass.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/acc4p0:**

`AK` stands for `All Kill`.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/acc4p6:**

The function to implement is to return `true` if ~n~ is happy. The definition of happy numbers can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/piggy:**

Submitting `Unicode` in Text, `:Xyene` in Text, or `print('Moana')` in Python 3, will likely to make you pass.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/scroll:**

There is no input for this problem. It seems like any non-empty output can pass.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/saoj:**

Input ~N~, output ~\sum\limits_{k=0}^{N} k^6 = \dfrac{1}{42}(6N^7+21N^6+21N^5-7N^3+N)~, modulo ~1000000000~.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/cccjqrp3:**

All inputs can be fit into a 64-bit unsigned integer. Your task is to output ~A+B+C~, modulo ~42069900169420~.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/bf1easy:**

Read the problem statement carefully. It tells you to output the integers from ~1~ to ~N~.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/toosimple:**

One can see from existing comments that these characters are not allowed in code: `"'1234567890`.

This problem asks you to recognize digits from bitmap images. The first line of input contains an integer, ~N~, the number of test images. Followed by ~28N~ lines, each line contains ~28~ real numbers between ~0~ and ~1~, representing ~N~ ~28\times28~ bitmap images, where each image contains a decimal digit. Your program should output ~N~ lines, each line indicates the digit in the image.

The image represented in the sample input can be found in [this comment](https://dmoj.ca/problem/tle18p1#comment-12374).

This problem contains 10 test cases. In all test cases, ~N=1000~. If your program has a proper output, you will receive feedback for the accuracy of your algorithm.

The maximum points for this problem is 512. One guesses the points is calculated as ~\lfloor2^{\lfloor20(a-0.5)\rfloor}\rfloor~, where ~a~ is the minimum accuracy of all test cases.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/cccjqrp5:**

The input for this problem is a lowercase English letter. When the input is `a`, the answer is `a`. Otherwise, the answer is the answer to the previous letter of the input letter in the English alphabet plus the input letter plus the answer for the previous letter in the English alphabet.

For example, when the input is `b`, your output should be `a`+`b`+`a`=`aba`. When the input is `c`, your output should be `aba`+`c`+`aba`=`abacaba`.

If the instruction count of your code is greater than or equal to 1000, only 3/4 of points will be given. The grader may return WA even though your output matches.

**https://dmoj.ca/problem/csprng:**

If your program tries to request, it crashes.

If your program outputs `the following file`, the grader's feedback will be `Nice try, print the actual file`.

To fail solutions that use data compression, the grader is updated to detect non-ASCII characters.

Notice problem statement:

> a hardware token that he has locally ...... uniformly at random within the range configured
> Your score will be inversely correlated to the length of your program.
> To ensure you have the correct output......
