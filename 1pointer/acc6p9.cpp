Hello kirito, i need your help  you know regular users cannot delete their comments on dmoj and there is a thing called cloudflare that kicks out users? well i think i have an account harry7557558 got kicked out for spam editing one of his comments and i cant log in to that account, well, when i was doing that i didnt think and didnt try to do things properly before it is kicked out is it possible for you to delete that comment and clear the profile description of harry7557558 (or contact someone who can) before one year after that incident thanks
