## Formal About

Self-taught ~~graphics~~ programmer. Enjoy optimizing the constant.

First heard DMOJ from [user:mrgallo]. Currently have 5 DMOJ accounts. (see ***Alts***)

Don't like to meet people due to certain mental illness.

--------

**Motivations to learn computer programming:**

- To construct a virtual world on a computer using physics laws (child naive thought but it's my first motivation)

- For convenience in computer use and problem-solving

- Having a new interest

- So that I can hack someone

--------

**Many problems I stuck for long become the fastest sub when I first got AC.**

Some examples:

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/pacnw16e (2.9x faster, resubmit a more readable code and got 3.3x faster)

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/cco09p1 (1.9x1.8â‰ˆ3.5x faster, did in two accounts by [optimizing the constant](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/lecture-notes/MIT6_837F12_Lec14.pdf#page=15))

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccoprep2p1 (1.7x faster, another constant optimization)

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/angieandfunctions (0.94x time, 0.1x memory after my alt discovered a 1.7x faster ~O(N^2)~ solution)

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc19c7p4 (1.06x faster, fun problem)

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19s3 Top 3 fastest subs of this ~~infamous~~ problem used to be my alts -- in **three different algorithms**

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/cco20p1 (1.3x, this 10p problem tortured me long and I was surprised to see my first AC solution become the fastest sub)

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/pathfind (1.4x speed 0.15x memory - at first I didn't expect I could solve it but my alt gets top)

- https://dmoj.ca/problem/cco07p2 (3.04x faster)

- ~~https://dmoj.ca/problem/det (1.3x)~~ The fastest sub is an improper solution from my alt, which brought me trouble

--------

**Things I want to learn myself but have difficulties:**

- Those named after Fourier

- Green/Gauss/Stokes/grad/div/curl

- Computer Vision / Deep Neural Network

- Solving PDEs numerically

- Learn how to use Maxwell's equations

--------

## Tips

An infamous optimization template for C++:

    #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast"
    #pragma GCC optimize "unroll-loops"
    #pragma GCC target "sse,sse2,sse3,sse4,abm,avx,mmx,popcnt"

Fast C++ IO see [this profile page](https://dmoj.ca/user/Dingledooper).

--------

To get the fastest submission in constant time problems like [ccc19s3](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19s3) and [wac2p4](https://dmoj.ca/problem/wac2p4), instead of using `Ofast`, use:

    #pragma GCC optimize "Os"
